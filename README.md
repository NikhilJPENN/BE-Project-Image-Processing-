Developed a software application in MATLAB for comparative analysis of image enhancement and noise removal and edge detection techniques.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF AIVHE, RETINEX AND ADAPTIVE EGDE DETECTION

The goal of segmentation is to simplify and change the representation of an image into something
that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects
and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. We usually try to segment regions by identifying
common properties. Or, similarly, we identify contours by identifying differences between regions
(edges). In this project we are developing adaptive edge detection methods which will be more
effective than other traditional operator methods. It combines the advantage of the filters to different
noises and new contrast image enhancement method AIVHE (Adaptive Increasingly Value
Histogram Equalization Histogram) or Retinex. Also smoothness of image can be quantified by using
measuring the energy in the image at high frequencies. The smoothness coefficient is gives the this
value and direct us whether there is necessity of enhancement in image. We are proposing a new
algorithm and this algorithm improves the performance of the traditional test edge detection operators
and has good segmentation accuracy. The proposed algorithm first filters the noisy images, enhances
the contrast of the image by AIVHE or Retinex method accordingly with smoothness coefficient
which is then followed by adaptive edge detection. AIVHE is a relatively new method of histogram
equalization which has significant improvements as compared to the traditional methods. The input
image can produce the effect of contrast enhancement effectively by automatic adaptive increment,
the parameter α(k). Sometimes when the dynamic range of a scene exceeds the camera‟s dynamic range,
there can be irrevocable loss of visual information at both extremes of the scene dynamic range. Improved
fidelity of colour images to human observation should, therefore, combine dynamic range compression,
colour constancy, and colour and lightness rendition. The Multi scale Retinex (MSRCR) achieves all
these goals. Edge detection is a fundamental tool in image processing It is an important property of
extracting image characteristics in image segmentation, identification and analysis On the basis of
analyzing the conventional edge detection algorithm, SUSAN edge detection and adaptive edgedetection
method based on the operators not only keeps the operator‟s good performance in good
detection, good localization effectively control the most noise of the image and only one response to
a single edge, but also improves the capability of restraining the fake edge and the automaticity of
edge-detection.
